# TLS Decryption Script

A utility script for setting up Bettercap to perform TLS decryption through a man-in-the-middle proxy.

## Overview

This script automates the process of creating and deploying a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate used by Bettercap to intercept, decrypt, and inspect HTTPS traffic. It's designed for network security professionals, penetration testers, and system administrators who need to analyze encrypted traffic for legitimate purposes.

## Features

- Checks for Bettercap installation
- Generates a CA certificate automatically
- Verifies successful certificate creation
- Copies the certificate for easy distribution
- Provides guidance for certificate installation on various operating systems
- Network reconnaissance to discover devices
  - Computer/device type identification
  - Hostname resolution
  - IP address mapping
- Detailed device scanning with OS fingerprinting
- Traffic monitoring to analyze network destinations
- Live network dashboard with web interface
- Network traffic logging (DNS requests, MAC addresses, IP addresses)
- Cookie capture from HTTP/HTTPS traffic

## Prerequisites

- Linux-based operating system
- Bettercap installed
- OpenSSL installed
- Root or sudo privileges
- Nmap (optional, for enhanced device fingerprinting)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this script to your local machine
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x tls_decryption.sh
   ```

## Usage

Run the script with root privileges:

```bash
sudo ./tls_decryption.sh
```

The script will present an interactive menu with the following options:

1. **Generate CA certificate for HTTPS decryption**
   - Creates a certificate at `~/.bettercap-ca.cert.pem`
   - Verifies the certificate and displays its details
   - Copies the certificate to your current directory

2. **Network reconnaissance**
   - Discovers devices on the local network
   - Shows MAC addresses, IP addresses, and hostnames when available
   - Displays vendor information to help identify device types

3. **Detailed device scan**
   - Performs OS fingerprinting to determine device types
   - Scans for open ports and services
   - Provides more comprehensive device identification

4. **Monitor network traffic**
   - Shows real-time traffic flows
   - Displays source and destination IP addresses
   - Identifies protocols and services being used

5. **Log network traffic**
   - Records DNS requests, MAC addresses, and IP addresses
   - Saves traffic data to a timestamped log file
   - Provides a summary of top DNS requests and IP addresses

6. **Capture cookies**
   - Extracts cookies from HTTP/HTTPS traffic
   - Saves cookies to a timestamped file
   - Shows domain, path, and cookie content
   - Particularly useful for session analysis

7. **Launch web dashboard**
   - Starts Bettercap's web interface
   - Provides a graphical view of network activity
   - Accessible via browser at http://127.0.0.1:80

## How It Works

The script leverages Bettercap's proxy capabilities to set up a man-in-the-middle position. By creating a custom CA certificate and installing it on target devices, the script enables the decryption and inspection of TLS/SSL encrypted traffic.

### Certificate Distribution

After generating the certificate, you must distribute and install it on any device you wish to monitor. The script provides guidance for installing the certificate on:
- Android
- iOS
- Windows
- macOS

### Running Bettercap

Once the certificate is installed on target devices, you can run Bettercap with the following command to begin intercepting traffic:

```bash
bettercap -eval "http.proxy on; https.proxy on; http.proxy.sslstrip true;"
```

## Security and Ethical Considerations

This tool should only be used in environments where you have explicit permission to monitor network traffic. Potential legitimate uses include:

- Network troubleshooting and debugging
- Security testing with proper authorization
- Educational environments
- Your own personal devices

## Troubleshooting

- **Certificate not generated**: Run Bettercap manually and check for errors
- **Certificate not trusted**: Ensure you've followed the correct installation steps for the target OS
- **No traffic intercepted**: Verify network configuration and routing to ensure traffic passes through the proxy

## Legal Disclaimer

Using this tool to intercept network traffic without authorization may violate computer fraud and abuse laws, privacy laws, and organizational policies. The author of this script assumes no liability for misuse or for any damages resulting from the use of this tool. Use responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission.
